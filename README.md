# Case-Based-Simulation-Builder
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The Case-Based Simulation Developer is a web application that will allow developers to design and construct authentic simulated environments where users can then access and interact with those simulations. The Case-Base Simulation consists of four primary user interventions or “nodes:” scenario, information-gathering, decision-making, and end. The user starts with a problem set, or scenario node. Then, the simulation as a decision tree allows the user to gather data and to make decisions based on environmental or situational conditions, leading them through a series of multiple and possible branched pathways. The user completes the simulation at the end node, where their judgments (how effectively they interacted with the simulation) are evaluated.</li>
    <li>I was responsible for devising algorithms using a stack to check tree simulation integrity and find the optimal path of the simulation. I also loaded/saved simulations from the database into a graph data structure, created the video upload functionality, and wrote the requirements document.</li>
    <li>The associated firebase account and data has since closed so the functionality of the project may be limited. To account for this, documentation of the project has been included in the repository.</li>
